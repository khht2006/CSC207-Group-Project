# Grapes - Finding the Most Efficient Route

    - This software is a project for the course CSC207 at the University of Toronto

    - **Distribution without permission is strongly prohibited**

# Final Presentation

# Functionalities and Specifications

- This app uses Swing GUI, allowing users to input their current location and destination to find total transit time 
and costs for their public transit options (biking and walking).
- Users can compare the time and costs between their transit options

# Code Organization

We organized our work into 5 layers:
- Package 'app' contains the classes, including the 'main.Main' class to initialize and connect the frontend and backend 
of our program.
- Package 'entity' contains the entities we designed, including 'Routes'.
- Package 'interface_adapter' contains classes to control the interface
- Package 'usecase' contains different use cases and their own components
- Package 'view' contains the classes to present the program to users. Mostly includes Swing GUI.
